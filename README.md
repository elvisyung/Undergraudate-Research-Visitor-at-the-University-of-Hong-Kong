# Undergraudate Research Visitor at The University of Hong Kong


Research Visitor supervised by lab PI Dr. Juan Diego Gaitan Espitia [https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/gaitnespitia-juan-diego-jd] and Ecology Ph.D student Coskun Guclu.

Project: Carried out independent research in molecular phylogeny in Salicaceae sensu stricto (s.s.) genera Populus & Salix along with a Coskun Glucu. Personally developed a R code that takes data from the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) database and maps the distribution of certain plant species. Benchmarked the parameters of the code and tested it with "Salix babylonica" which generated the distribution map found below. Developed this program to further understand the overall distribution of Salix and Poplus species, hoping to gain a better understanding of the geographical locations, leading to resolving the controversy between the molecular phylogeny of Salicaceae Populus and Salix species.
